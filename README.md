 its almost effortless :(
 
feel free to modify for your own classes 
this script automatically opens your default browser and it uses cookies to automatically login to your canvas account 

your probably going to have to create a exe file for the script so youre just going to have to look up how to convert the recompiled .py to exe :) or do some other fuckery on linux haha
So.. you want to be lazy?

FOR WINBLOWS:
For you windows users: u need to make a shortcut of the shell script(.bat) and copy that into your startup folder.
That bat file should follow the format of mine
you can find your startup folder by doing Windows+R and type in "shell:startup" and move that shortcut into there 
wolla it should work on start up

FOR LINUX:
fuck u linux users, figure it out on your own. its the linux way
